# Baseline NLP System for French Sustainability Discourse Analysis

## Documentation Overview

This documentation package is intended for the MLOps Engineer who will be deploying, maintaining, and potentially extending the baseline NLP system for French sustainability discourse analysis.

## Documentation Structure

- **system_architecture/**
  - `overview.md` - High-level architecture and system design
  
- **components/**
  - `topic_identification.md` - TextRank algorithm for topic extraction
  - `opinion_detection.md` - Lexicon-based sentiment analysis
  - `paradox_detection.md` - Rule-based paradox detection
  - `temporal_context.md` - Context distinction between present and future
  
- **data_formats/**
  - `input_output_formats.md` - JSON schema descriptions for input and output data
  
- **deployment/**
  - `deployment_guide.md` - Step-by-step instructions for system deployment

## Key Features of the Baseline NLP System

1. **Modular Design**: Each component can be maintained or replaced independently
2. **Configurable Parameters**: All component settings can be adjusted via configuration files
3. **Well-Documented Code**: Extensive docstrings and comments within the code
4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from component failures
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Optimized resource usage, especially for memory-intensive operations

## System Performance

The current implementation has successfully processed all 8 tables of the French sustainability discourse dataset, generating labeled output for:
- Topic identification
- Opinion/sentiment analysis
- Paradox detection
- Temporal context distinction

Performance metrics will be updated once the expert-validated sample is available for evaluation.

## Contact for Technical Support

For technical questions or issues during deployment, contact the Machine Learning Engineer team at [ml-team@example.com].

## Next Steps

1. Review the system architecture overview to understand the system's design
2. Familiarize yourself with each component's documentation
3. Follow the deployment guide to set up the system
4. Run initial performance tests using the evaluation scripts

Thank you for taking over the operational management of this NLP system. The modular design should make it straightforward to maintain and extend as needed.
