# Paradox Detection Evaluation Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan outlines the approach for evaluating the performance of the paradox detection component in the French Sustainability NLP system. The paradox detection module is designed to identify linguistic paradoxes in sustainability discourse using rule-based approaches.

## Test Objectives
1. Evaluate the accuracy of the paradox detection component
2. Assess performance against expert-validated samples
3. Analyze specific rule performance (antonym pairs, negated repetition, sustainability tensions, contrastive structures)
4. Determine if the confidence threshold is appropriately calibrated

## Testing Approach
We will create and use a set of test cases designed to evaluate each aspect of the paradox detection system:

### Test Case Categories

#### 1. Clear Paradoxes
Text segments that contain obvious paradoxes that the system should detect with high confidence.
- Examples with antonym pairs
- Examples with negated repetition
- Examples with sustainability tensions
- Examples with contrastive structures

#### 2. Non-Paradoxes
Text segments that clearly do not contain paradoxes and should be classified as such.
- Simple factual statements
- Consistent argumentation
- No contradictory elements

#### 3. Borderline Cases
Text segments that could be interpreted as paradoxical depending on context or interpretation.
- Subtle tensions
- Segments with low expected confidence scores
- Complex linguistic structures

#### 4. Expert-Validated Samples
Samples from the actual dataset that have been validated by domain experts.
- Compare system classification with expert classification
- Evaluate confidence scores against expert certainty

## Test Process
1. Prepare a test dataset containing a mix of the above categories
2. Process each test case through the paradox detection component
3. Compare actual results with expected results
4. Calculate performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)
5. Analyze error patterns and identify opportunities for improvement

## Specific Test Conditions
- The system should correctly identify paradoxes with the mechanisms it's designed to detect
- The confidence scores should reflect the strength of the paradox indication
- The system should avoid false positives in clearly non-paradoxical text
- The weighted combination of detection mechanisms should produce sensible overall results

## Test Execution Environment
- Python version: Same as development environment
- Required libraries: spaCy, other NLP libraries
- Data files: French antonyms, sustainability terms, tension keywords

## Test Pass/Fail Criteria
- Precision and recall should exceed 0.7 on expert-validated samples
- F1-score should exceed 0.7 on expert-validated samples
- False positive rate should be below 0.3
- System should demonstrate consistent performance across different rule types
