## Detailed Test Results

### TC-TC-001: Temporal Markers Detection
- **Input**: Three text samples (present, future, and mixed)
- **Expected Result**: Detection of appropriate temporal markers in each text
- **Actual Result**: 
  - Present text: Detected markers ["aujourd'hui", "moderne", "2023", "en 2023"]
  - Future text: Detected markers ["2050", "en 2050"]
  - Mixed text: Detected both present and future markers
- **Status**: PASS

### TC-TC-002: Verb Tense Detection
- **Input**: Three text samples with different tense usage
- **Expected Result**: Correct identification of verb tenses
- **Actual Result**: 
  - Present text: Detected 2 present tense verbs
  - Future text: Detected 2 future tense verbs
  - Present-for-future text: Correctly identified present tense used for future reference
- **Status**: PASS

### TC-TC-003: Present Tense Disambiguation
- **Input**: "Demain, nous partons en mission pour sauver la plan√®te."
- **Expected Result**: Detection of present tense used for future reference
- **Actual Result**: Detected 1 occurrence of present-for-future usage
- **Status**: PASS

### TC-TC-004: Overall Temporal Context Analysis
- **Input**: Three text samples (present, future, and ambiguous)
- **Expected Result**: Correct context identification with confidence scores
- **Actual Result**: 
  - Present text: Identified as "present" with confidence 0.94
  - Future text: Identified as "future" with confidence 0.95
  - Ambiguous text: Identified as "present" with lower confidence 0.61
- **Status**: PASS

### TC-TC-005: Single Segment Processing
- **Input**: Two segments (present and future contexts)
- **Expected Result**: Segments enriched with temporal context information
- **Actual Result**: Successfully added temporal context information to both segments
  - Present segment: context="present", confidence=0.58
  - Future segment: context="future", confidence=0.87
- **Status**: PASS

### TC-TC-006: Multiple Segment Processing
- **Input**: Three segments with different temporal contexts
- **Expected Result**: All segments processed with appropriate context information
- **Actual Result**: Successfully processed all segments
  - First segment: context="present"
  - Second segment: context="future"
  - Third segment: context="present" (ambiguous)
- **Status**: PASS

## Issues Encountered

One issue was encountered during testing and has been resolved. See [test_issues.md](./test_issues.md) for details on how the present tense disambiguation was fixed.

## Recommendations

1. **Data Completeness**: The module performs well with the existing temporal markers. Consider expanding the marker lists with more domain-specific terms related to sustainability discourse.

2. **Confidence Scoring**: The module provides reasonable confidence scores, but real-world evaluation on a larger corpus would help validate and fine-tune these scores.

3. **French Verb Tense Patterns**: Consider creating the missing verb tense patterns file (french_verb_tense_patterns.csv) to enhance the detection of complex verb forms beyond the default patterns.

## Conclusion

The Temporal Context Analysis Module successfully passes all test cases and demonstrates robust capabilities for distinguishing between present (2023) and future (2050) contexts in French sustainability discourse. The module handles both explicit temporal markers and implicit temporal references through verb tense analysis, including the important case of present tense used to refer to future events in French.

The initial issue with present tense disambiguation has been resolved, and the module now correctly identifies when present tense is being used to refer to future events, which is a common linguistic pattern in French.
