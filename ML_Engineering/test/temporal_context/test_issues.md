### ISSUE-TC-001: Present Tense Disambiguation Not Working for Simple Cases
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Date Identified**: April 23, 2025
- **Identified By**: GitHub Copilot
- **Description**: The present tense disambiguation mechanism wasn't correctly identifying when present tense is used to refer to future events in simple cases with a single verb. This is particularly important in French, where using present tense to talk about future events is common.
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. Run the test with the text "Demain, nous partons en mission pour sauver la plan√®te."
  2. Observe that even though "demain" (tomorrow) clearly indicates a future event, the present tense verb "partons" was not being flagged as "present_for_future".
- **Expected Behavior**: The present tense verb "partons" should be identified as being used for future reference due to the temporal marker "demain".
- **Actual Behavior**: No verbs were being identified as "present_for_future" because the calculation was resulting in 0 verbs to reassign.
- **Resolution**: Enhanced the `disambiguate_present_tense` method to include special handling for obvious cases with immediate future markers, and adjusted the calculation to ensure at least one verb is marked as "present_for_future" when clear future signals are present in the text.
- **Resolution Date**: April 23, 2025
