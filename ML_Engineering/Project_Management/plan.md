## Plan for Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist

This plan outlines the steps for the Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist to build the baseline NLP system for opinion analysis of French sustainability discussions.

**Phase 1: Data Ingestion and Research Review**

1.  Receive the preprocessed dataset from the Data Engineer [cite: report.txt].
2.  Thoroughly review the provided reports on Topic Identification [cite: Ticket1_French_Sustainability_Topic_Identification.txt], Opinion Detection [cite: Ticket2_French_Sentiment_Analysis_Techniques.txt], Paradox Detection [cite: Ticket3_Paradox_Detection_Rule-Based_Approach.txt], and Temporal Context Distinction [cite: Ticket4_French_Temporal_Context_Analysis.txt].

**Phase 2: Baseline NLP Model Development and Implementation**

1.  **Topic Identification:**
    * Research and select an appropriate advanced keyword extraction technique [cite: Ticket1_French_Sustainability_Topic_Identification.txt].
    * Implement the chosen algorithm using relevant Python libraries [cite: Ticket1_French_Sustainability_Topic_Identification.txt].
    * Detail the implemented algorithm and its parameters [cite: Ticket1_French_Sustainability_Topic_Identification.txt].
2.  **Opinion Detection:**
    * Research and select a suitable sentiment analysis approach for French text [cite: Ticket2_French_Sentiment_Analysis_Techniques.txt].
    * Implement the chosen method, considering negation and contrastive markers [cite: Ticket2_French_Sentiment_Analysis_Techniques.txt].
    * Detail the implemented method and resources used (e.g., lexicons) [cite: Ticket2_French_Sentiment_Analysis_Techniques.txt].
3.  **Paradox Detection (Baseline):**
    * Develop and implement rule-based methods for paradox detection based on linguistic signatures [cite: Ticket3_Paradox_Detection_Rule-Based_Approach.txt].
    * Document each implemented rule with its pattern and purpose [cite: Ticket3_Paradox_Detection_Rule-Based_Approach.txt].
4.  **Temporal Context Distinction:**
    * Develop and implement rule-based methods to identify temporal contexts (2023 vs. 2050) [cite: Ticket4_French_Temporal_Context_Analysis.txt].
    * Document each implemented rule for verb tense and temporal marker analysis [cite: Ticket4_French_Temporal_Context_Analysis.txt].

**Phase 3: Model Output and Dataset Labeling**

1.  Process the preprocessed dataset using the implemented topic identification, opinion detection, paradox detection, and temporal context distinction modules.
2.  Generate a labeled dataset with the results [cite: report.txt].
3.  Save the code for all implemented modules.

**Phase 4: Initial Performance Evaluation**

1.  Document the evaluation metrics.

**Phase 5: Artifact Preparation and Handoff**

1.  Package the labeled dataset, model implementation scripts, and performance report.
2.  Provide comprehensive documentation for all implemented algorithms and the overall model to the MLOps Engineer.
