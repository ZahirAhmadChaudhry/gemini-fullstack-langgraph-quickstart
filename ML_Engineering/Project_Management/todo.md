## To-Do List for Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist

This to-do list outlines the tasks for the Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist to build the baseline NLP system.

**Phase 1: Data Ingestion and Research Review**

* ✓ Receive the preprocessed dataset from the Data Engineer.
* ✓ Read and understand the research reports on:
    * ✓ Topic Identification [cite: Ticket1_French_Sustainability_Topic_Identification.txt]
    * ✓ Opinion Detection [cite: Ticket2_French_Sentiment_Analysis_Techniques.txt]
    * ✓ Paradox Detection [cite: Ticket3_Paradox_Detection_Rule-Based_Approach.txt]
    * ✓ Temporal Context Distinction [cite: Ticket4_French_Temporal_Context_Analysis.txt]

**Phase 2: Baseline NLP Model Development and Implementation**

* **Topic Identification:**
    * [x] Choose an advanced keyword extraction technique: TextRank algorithm
    * [x] Implement the chosen algorithm in Python
    * [x] Write detailed documentation for the topic identification algorithm
* **Opinion Detection:**
    * [x] Select a suitable sentiment analysis approach for French: Lexicon-based with French adaptations
    * [x] Implement the sentiment analysis method in Python
    * [x] Write detailed documentation for the opinion detection method
* **Paradox Detection (Baseline):**
    * [x] Develop rule-based methods for paradox detection
    * [x] Implement the paradox detection rules in Python
    * [x] Write detailed documentation for each paradox detection rule
* **Temporal Context Distinction:**
    * [x] Develop rule-based methods for temporal context distinction
    * [x] Implement the temporal context distinction rules in Python
    * [x] Write detailed documentation for each temporal context distinction rule

**Phase 3: Model Output and Dataset Labeling**

* [x] Process the preprocessed dataset using the implemented modules
* [x] Generate the labeled dataset
* [x] Save all implementation code

**Phase 4: Initial Performance Evaluation** (TO DO)

* [ ] Write a report on the initial model performance

**Phase 5: Artifact Preparation and Handoff**

* [x] Prepare the labeled dataset, model scripts, and performance report
* [x] Write comprehensive documentation for the MLOps Engineer

**Remaining Tasks:**
1. Evaluate system performance using expert-validated samples when available
2. Write initial performance report based on evaluation results
