**Notes:** 
- April 16, 2025: Completed implementation of all four components of the baseline NLP system. Successfully ran the pipeline on all eight preprocessed tables and generated labeled outputs stored in the labeled_output directory.
- April 16, 2025: Created comprehensive documentation for the MLOps Engineer including system architecture overview, component-specific documentation, data format specifications, and a deployment guide.
- Next steps: Need to conduct performance evaluation using the expert-validated sample once it's available.
