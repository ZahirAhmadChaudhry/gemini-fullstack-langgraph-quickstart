# Problem to Solution Documentation - Baseline NLP System

This document records technical challenges encountered during the development of the baseline NLP system for French sustainability discourse analysis and their corresponding solutions.

## Challenge 1: Processing French Text with NLP Tools

**Problem**: Most NLP libraries have better support for English than French, making advanced analysis more challenging.

**Solution**: We utilized the French language model from spaCy (`fr_core_news_lg`), which provided robust support for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic parsing specifically for French text. This served as the foundation for all our NLP components.

## Challenge 2: Creating an Appropriate Sentiment Lexicon for Sustainability Discourse

**Problem**: Standard sentiment lexicons aren't tailored to sustainability discourse, leading to misinterpretations of domain-specific terms and expressions.

**Solution**: We created a custom French sentiment lexicon that included sustainability-specific terminology. This was implemented as a CSV file with terms and their associated polarities, which could be easily expanded as needed.

## Challenge 3: Detecting Paradoxes in Complex Sustainability Discussions

**Problem**: Paradoxes in sustainability discourse are often expressed through subtle linguistic patterns that are difficult to capture with rule-based systems.

**Solution**: We implemented a multi-layered approach that:
1. Detected co-occurrence of antonyms within close proximity
2. Identified tension keywords that signal paradoxical thinking
3. Analyzed syntactic structures that often indicate contrasting ideas

## Challenge 4: Distinguishing Temporal Contexts (2023 vs. 2050)

**Problem**: French discourse about present vs. future sustainability contexts often uses ambiguous temporal references that aren't clearly marked.

**Solution**: We developed a robust temporal context distinction component that:
1. Built comprehensive lists of present and future temporal markers
2. Analyzed verb tenses for temporal significance
3. Combined these signals to determine whether text segments referred to present (2023) or future (2050) contexts

## Challenge 5: Integrating Multiple NLP Components into a Unified Pipeline

**Problem**: Each NLP component (topic identification, sentiment analysis, paradox detection, and temporal context) operated with different parameters and outputs.

**Solution**: We designed a modular pipeline architecture where:
1. Each component was implemented as a separate module with standardized interfaces
2. The main pipeline class coordinated the data flow between components
3. Components could be independently refined without affecting the overall system

## Challenge 6: Ensuring Efficient Processing of Large Text Corpora

**Problem**: Processing large amounts of French text through multiple NLP components was computationally intensive.

**Solution**: We implemented several optimizations:
1. Loaded spaCy models only once and shared them across components
2. Used efficient data structures for lexicon lookups
3. Implemented batch processing for segments to balance memory usage and processing speed

## Next Steps

For future iterations of the system, we plan to:
1. Integrate machine learning approaches for improved paradox detection
2. Expand our lexical resources based on analysis of processed data
3. Implement more sophisticated topic modeling techniques beyond keyword extraction
