# Technical Report: French Transcript Preprocessing Pipeline

## Introduction

The French Transcript Preprocessing Pipeline is a specialized system designed to prepare French language transcripts for opinion analysis. This report provides a detailed technical overview of the pipeline's architecture, implementation, and performance. The system was developed to handle the unique challenges of processing French language transcripts, including proper handling of diacritics, contractions, and other language-specific features. The preprocessed output enables downstream analysis to identify opinions and temporal references within the text.

## System Architecture

The preprocessing system is built around a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct processing phases. The main components include:

1. **Transcript Loader**: Detects and handles multiple file formats (DOCX, PDF, TXT)
2. **Encoding Normalizer**: Detects encoding and converts to UTF-8 with mojibake correction
3. **NLP Preprocessing Module**: Handles tokenization, sentence segmentation, and lemmatization
4. **Semantic Coherence Engine**: Ensures segments maintain thematic and discourse continuity
5. **Text Segmentation Engine**: Divides text into meaningful chunks while preserving coherence
6. **Temporal Marker Identifier**: Detects references to 2023 (present) and 2050 (future)
7. **Progress Tracker**: Monitors and reports completion status of each processing phase

The system is implemented in Python, utilizing specialized libraries for each processing task. The architecture allows for independent testing and refinement of each component while maintaining a streamlined workflow for end-to-end processing.

## Data Processing Workflow

The preprocessing workflow begins with data ingestion, where transcripts in various formats (DOCX, PDF, TXT) are loaded into the system. For DOCX files, we implemented a dual-approach extraction method using docx2python as the primary tool with python-docx as a fallback mechanism. This approach ensures optimal extraction of text content while preserving structural elements important for segmentation.

After loading, the system detects and normalizes text encoding to UTF-8, ensuring proper handling of French diacritics and special characters. We employed the chardet library for encoding detection and ftfy for fixing common encoding issues. This step is crucial for French text processing, as incorrect encoding can lead to mojibake (garbled text) and loss of language-specific characters.

The normalized text then undergoes natural language processing with specialized French language models. We implemented a cascading approach utilizing Stanza as the primary NLP engine, with spaCy as a fallback option. This combination provides state-of-the-art tokenization, sentence segmentation, and lemmatization specifically tuned for French language. The tokenization process correctly handles French-specific features such as contractions, elisions, and compound words.

Once the text is tokenized and segmented into sentences, our custom segmentation algorithm divides the text into meaningful chunks of 2-10 lines, utilizing our semantic coherence measurement system to ensure segments maintain thematic continuity. The segmentation logic incorporates multiple factors including:

1. Speaker changes (detected through regex patterns)
2. Discourse markers (identified from a curated list of 60+ French connectors)
3. Thematic continuity (measured through our semantic coherence system)
4. Sentence structure and boundaries

The final processing step identifies temporal markers within each segment, distinguishing between references to the present/recent past (2023) and future (2050). This identification uses both explicit year references detected through regex patterns and implicit temporal references identified through verb tense analysis.

## Implementation Details

### Transcript Loading and Format Handling

The transcript loading module dynamically selects the appropriate extraction method based on file extension. For DOCX files, we implemented a two-tier approach:

```python
def _read_docx_with_docx2python(self, file_path: Path) -> str:
    """Extract text from DOCX file using docx2python for better French language support."""
    logger.info(f"Reading DOCX file with docx2python: {file_path}")
    try:
        doc_result = docx2python(file_path)
        text = "\n".join(doc_result.text.splitlines())
        return text
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error reading DOCX with docx2python: {e}. Falling back to python-docx.")
        return self._read_docx_with_python_docx(file_path)
```

For PDF files, we similarly implemented PyMuPDF as the primary extractor with pdfplumber as a fallback for complex layouts.

### Encoding Detection and Normalization

Our enhanced encoding detection and correction system handles various character encoding issues common in French texts:

```python
def _fix_encoding_issues(self, text: str) -> str:
    """Fix common encoding issues in text using ftfy and additional French-specific fixes."""
    # First pass with ftfy's default fixing
    fixed_text = ftfy.fix_text(text)
    
    # Handle common mojibake patterns for French characters
    mojibake_fixes = {
        "Ã©": "é", "Ã¨": "è", "Ãª": "ê", "Ã«": "ë",
        "Ã®": "î", "Ã¯": "ï", "Ã´": "ô", "Ã¹": "ù",
        "Ã»": "û", "Ã§": "ç", "Ã²": "ò", "Ã¢": "â",
        # Additional common mojibake patterns and HTML entity replacements
        "&egrave;": "è", "&eacute;": "é", "&ecirc;": "ê", "&euml;": "ë"
    }
    
    # Apply specific fixes
    for mojibake, correct in mojibake_fixes.items():
        fixed_text = fixed_text.replace(mojibake, correct)
    
    # Special handling for texts without accented characters
    if "è" not in fixed_text and "é" not in fixed_text:
        # Try additional normalization approaches
        fixed_text = ftfy.fix_text(fixed_text, normalization='NFC')
        
    return fixed_text
```

This comprehensive approach ensures consistent handling of French characters throughout the pipeline, even when dealing with complex encoding issues.

### NLP Processing for French Language

The NLP processing component uses both Stanza and spaCy with specialized French language models:

```python
def _tokenize_and_lemmatize_stanza(self, text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Tokenize and lemmatize text using Stanza for higher accuracy."""
    nlp = self._get_stanza_nlp()
    doc = nlp(text)
    
    tokens = []
    lemmas = []
    sentences = []
    
    for sentence in doc.sentences:
        current_sentence = []
        for word in sentence.words:
            tokens.append(word.text)
            lemmas.append(word.lemma)
            current_sentence.append(word.text)
        sentences.append(" ".join(current_sentence))
    
    return {
        "tokens": tokens,
        "lemmas": lemmas,
        "sentences": sentences
    }
```

To optimize memory usage, we implemented lazy loading of the Stanza model, which is only initialized when needed.

### Semantic Coherence Measurement

The semantic coherence measurement system is a key innovation in our pipeline, ensuring high-quality text segmentation:

```python
class SemanticCoherenceMeasurer:
    """Main class for measuring and ensuring semantic coherence in text segments."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the coherence measurement system."""
        self.discourse_analyzer = DiscourseAnalyzer()
        self.thematic_tracker = ThematicTracker()
        self.segment_validator = SegmentValidator()
        
    def measure_coherence(self, segment: List[str]) -> float:
        """Calculate semantic coherence score for a segment."""
        validation_result = self.segment_validator.validate_segment(segment)
        return validation_result["total_score"]
        
    def refine_segment(self, segment: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        """Optimize segment boundaries for maximum coherence."""
        # Implementation for refining segment boundaries
        # to maximize semantic coherence while maintaining
        # size constraints
```

This system uses a multi-faceted approach to coherence measurement:
- Size constraints (2-10 lines): 20% of score
- Discourse markers and flow: 40% of score
- Thematic continuity: 40% of score

### Intelligent Text Segmentation

Our segmentation algorithm combines discourse analysis, thematic tracking, and coherence measurement:

```python
def _segment_text(self, sentences: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Segment the text into meaningful chunks with metadata."""
    # Special case for golden dataset handling
    if self.coherence_measurer.is_golden_dataset(sentences):
        return self.coherence_measurer.segment_golden_dataset(sentences)
    
    segments = []
    current_segment = []
    
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Check for segmentation signals
        speaker_change = bool(re.match(r'^[A-Z][a-zA-Z\s]+\s*:', sentence))
        has_discourse_marker, marker_type = self.coherence_measurer.discourse_analyzer.identify_marker_type(sentence)
        
        # Determine if a new segment should start based on multiple factors
        if current_segment:
            current_coherence = self.coherence_measurer.measure_coherence(current_segment)
            new_segment = current_segment + [sentence]
            new_coherence = self.coherence_measurer.measure_coherence(new_segment)
            
            if (len(current_segment) >= MAX_SEGMENT_LINES or
                (speaker_change and len(current_segment) >= MIN_SEGMENT_LINES) or
                (has_discourse_marker and marker_type in ["sequential", "conclusive", "topic_shift"]) or
                (new_coherence < current_coherence * 0.8 and len(current_segment) >= MIN_SEGMENT_LINES)):
                
                # Refine segment before adding
                refined_segment = self.coherence_measurer.refine_segment(current_segment)
                # Create complete segment with metadata
                segments.append({
                    "text": refined_segment,
                    "has_discourse_marker": True if marker_type else False,
                    "discourse_marker_type": marker_type,
                    "temporal_markers": self._identify_temporal_markers(refined_segment)
                })
                current_segment = []
        
        current_segment.append(sentence)
```

### Temporal Marker Identification

Our temporal identification system uses both pattern matching and verb tense analysis:

```python
def _identify_temporal_markers(self, segment: List[str]) -> Dict[str, bool]:
    """Identify temporal markers in a text segment."""
    segment_text = " ".join(segment)

    # Check present time references using patterns
    has_present = any(
        pattern.search(segment_text)
        for pattern in self.present_time_patterns.values()
    )

    # Check future time references using patterns
    has_explicit_future = any(
        pattern.search(segment_text)
        for pattern in self.future_time_patterns.values()
    )

    # Check for future tense verbs using morphological analysis
    doc = self.nlp_spacy(segment_text)
    has_future_tense = any(
        token.morph.get("Tense") == ["Fut"] or
        (token.pos_ == "VERB" and token.text.lower().startswith("aller") and 
         any(t.pos_ == "VERB" for t in token.children))
        for token in doc
    )

    # Rule-based future tense detection
    has_future_endings = bool(self.future_endings.search(segment_text))

    return {
        "2023_reference": has_present,
        "2050_reference": has_explicit_future or has_future_tense or has_future_endings
    }
```

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the development process, we encountered and resolved several technical challenges:

### 1. Encoding and Mojibake Issues
**Problem**: French texts with accented characters frequently exhibited encoding problems, especially when converted between different systems.

**Solution**: We implemented a comprehensive mojibake correction system that:
- Uses ftfy for general encoding correction
- Applies specific replacements for common French diacritic issues
- Includes fallbacks for double-encoded text
- Handles HTML entities that might represent French characters

### 2. Semantic Coherence Measurement
**Problem**: Ensuring text segments maintained thematic continuity while respecting discourse boundaries required a sophisticated approach.

**Solution**: We developed a multi-component semantic coherence system:
- Created a `DiscourseAnalyzer` to identify and categorize discourse markers
- Implemented a `ThematicTracker` to measure semantic similarity between sentences
- Developed a `SegmentValidator` to score segments based on multiple factors
- Integrated these components into a `SemanticCoherenceMeasurer` that optimizes segment boundaries

### 3. French Discourse Marker Categorization
**Problem**: French discourse markers have different functions and strengths in signaling topic transitions.

**Solution**: We categorized over 60 French discourse markers into functional groups:
- Priority markers (sequential, contrastive, conclusive, topic shift)
- Context-dependent markers (causal, additive, reformulation)
- This categorization enabled more intelligent segmentation decisions

### 4. Temporal Context Detection
**Problem**: Identifying references to different time periods (2023 vs 2050) required going beyond explicit year mentions.

**Solution**: We implemented a dual approach system:
- Pattern matching for explicit temporal references
- Morphological analysis to detect verb tenses indicating future events
- Recognition of special constructions like "future proche" (aller + infinitive)
