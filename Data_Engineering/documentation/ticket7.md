Challenges in Detecting Temporal References in French Text using NLP Tools1. IntroductionAccurate detection of temporal references in French Natural Language Processing (NLP) is paramount for a multitude of applications, including information extraction, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering systems. The ability of an NLP system to correctly identify when events occur or when statements are valid is crucial for understanding the meaning conveyed in text. However, the French language presents several complexities that can hinder the performance of NLP tools in this domain. This report delves into specific challenges encountered in temporal reference detection in French, as highlighted by a recent user query. These challenges include the failure to detect implicit present time references, the inaccurate identification of future tense by the spaCy library, and the difficulty in recognizing combined present and future temporal references within a single discourse. This report aims to analyze these issues from both a linguistic and a technical standpoint, explore potential solutions based on current research and available NLP libraries, and ultimately provide recommendations for improving the accuracy of temporal reference detection in French NLP applications. The structure of this report will first address the intricacies of present time references in French, both explicit and implicit, followed by an examination of future tense conjugation and the limitations observed in spaCy. Subsequently, alternative NLP libraries with potential for improved performance will be explored. The report will then delve into the complexities of mixed temporal references in French discourse before concluding with a summary of findings and actionable recommendations.2. Decoding Implicit Present Time in FrenchIndicating the present time in French can be achieved through a variety of linguistic means, ranging from explicit temporal expressions to more subtle, implicit cues embedded within the grammatical structure and discourse context. Understanding both these facets is crucial for developing robust NLP systems capable of accurately identifying when a statement or event is situated in the present.2.1. Explicit French Temporal Expressions for the PresentFrench offers a rich array of explicit temporal expressions that clearly denote the present time.1 These expressions can be categorized based on their grammatical function, providing a structured overview for NLP systems aiming to identify them. Adverbs form a significant category, including common terms such as "aujourd'hui" (today), "ce matin" (this morning), "cet après-midi" (this afternoon), "ce soir" (this evening), "cette semaine" (this week), "ce mois-ci" (this month), "cette année" (this year), and "maintenant" (now).1 Additionally, "actuellement" (currently) also explicitly indicates the present.2 Adverbial phrases further contribute to this category, with examples like "à l'heure actuelle" and "situation présente" (at the present time, present situation) being key indicators of the present moment, as highlighted in the initial query. "En ce moment" (at this moment) also falls under this category.5Prepositional expressions combined with temporal nouns or adjectives also serve to specify the present. The preposition "depuis" (since/for) when used with the present tense of a verb, signifies an action or state that began in the past and continues into the present.6 For instance, "Je travaille ici depuis cinq ans" (I have been working here for five years) clearly anchors the action to the present.7 While "pendant" (during/for) and "pour" (for) primarily indicate duration, they can be used in the present tense to describe habitual actions occurring in the present timeframe.8Informal language also provides ways to explicitly refer to the present. Expressions like "ça fait...que" (it has been...that), "voilà...que" (there is/are...that), and "il y a...que" (there is/are...that) followed by a time duration and a verb in the present tense are common ways to express an action ongoing in the present.6 For example, "Ça fait deux heures que j'attends" (I have been waiting for two hours) clearly indicates a present state resulting from a past action.9The sheer number of these explicit present time expressions demonstrates the French language's capacity to precisely pinpoint the present moment.1 However, the existence of expressions like "tout à l'heure" which can denote either a recent past or an immediate future 2, underscores the necessity for NLP systems to consider the surrounding context to accurately disambiguate the intended temporal reference. Furthermore, the distinction between formal (e.g., "actuellement") and informal (e.g., "en ce moment") indicators suggests that NLP models should be sensitive to different registers of French to achieve comprehensive coverage.22.2. Implicit References to the PresentBeyond explicit temporal expressions, French speakers frequently indicate the present time through more implicit means, primarily relying on verb tense and the broader discourse context.5 The present tense conjugation of verbs plays a fundamental role in conveying actions or states occurring at the moment of speaking.15 For example, the simple statement "Je travaille" (I work/I am working) inherently refers to an action taking place in the present.15 This usage extends to habitual actions, as in "Oui, je travaille le dimanche" (Yes, I do work on Sundays), where the present tense signifies a recurring activity within the present timeframe.15 Notably, the present tense in French can also be used to describe actions that are about to occur in the near future, as illustrated by the sentence "Je travaille demain" (I'm working tomorrow).15 This is a common linguistic phenomenon where the present tense, coupled with a future time marker, conveys a sense of immediacy or certainty about a future event. Moreover, the present tense is the standard way to express general truths or facts that hold true in the present, such as "Le soleil se lève à l'est" (The sun rises in the east).15The use of the preposition "depuis" in conjunction with a verb conjugated in the present tense is another key way to implicitly indicate a present state or action that originated in the past and continues to the present.6 Examples like "Je vous téléphone depuis lundi" (I have been telephoning you since Monday) clearly demonstrate this ongoing present relevance of a past-initiated action.6Furthermore, the broader context of a discourse can often implicitly establish the present time frame.17 For instance, in a casual conversation about one's day, the use of present tense verbs without explicit temporal markers will generally be understood as referring to the present moment. Interestingly, the present tense can even be employed to describe past events in a narrative to create a sense of immediacy or suspense, effectively bringing the past into the "present" of the storytelling.17 This stylistic use highlights how context can override the typical temporal interpretation of a verb tense. Common French phrases used in everyday conversation, such as greetings like "Bonjour" or inquiries about well-being like "Ça va?" 21, typically operate within an implicit present time frame dictated by the immediate context of the interaction.The versatility of the French present tense, capable of indicating the immediate present, habits, near future, and even past events for stylistic purposes 15, presents a significant challenge for NLP systems. Disambiguating these various uses requires more than just identifying the verb tense; it necessitates an understanding of the surrounding context, including temporal adverbs, aspectual cues (like "depuis"), and the overall flow of the discourse. The ability to grasp these implicit cues is crucial for NLP systems to achieve a human-like understanding of temporal references in French.2.3. Challenges for NLP DetectionThe task of accurately detecting both explicit and implicit present time references in French text poses several challenges for NLP systems. Phrases like "à l'heure actuelle" and "situation présente," while seemingly straightforward indicators of the present, might be missed by some NLP libraries due to a variety of reasons. One likely factor is the lack of these specific multi-word expressions in the library's pre-defined vocabulary or gazetteers. NLP systems often rely on such lists to identify temporal markers, and if a particular phrase is not included, it will not be recognized as such. Another possibility is that the system has not been specifically trained to identify these combinations of words as temporal indicators. Machine learning models used in NLP learn patterns from the data they are trained on, and if phrases like "situation présente" are not sufficiently represented in the training data as referring to the present time, the model might fail to recognize them correctly.Furthermore, the potential ambiguity of certain phrases can also lead to detection failures. For example, while "situation présente" often refers to the current time, it could, in a more abstract or philosophical context, describe a general current state of affairs without a specific temporal anchoring. NLP systems need to be able to discern these subtle semantic differences to avoid misclassifications.Relying solely on explicit temporal markers presents a significant limitation for achieving a comprehensive understanding of the present time in French text. As discussed in the previous section, implicit references, particularly through the versatile present tense verb conjugations, are far more frequent and fundamental to how French speakers convey the present moment.15 An NLP system that only looks for keywords like "aujourd'hui" or "maintenant" will miss a vast number of instances where the present time is indicated through the use of the present tense to describe ongoing actions, habits, or near-future events.15The failure to detect common phrases like "à l'heure actuelle" suggests a need for continuous improvement in the vocabulary coverage of NLP tools for French temporal expressions. Regular updates incorporating new and less frequent idiomatic phrases are essential. Moreover, the ambiguity inherent in some expressions underscores the importance of moving beyond simple keyword matching and incorporating semantic analysis into NLP pipelines. Understanding the meaning of words and their relationships within the sentence and the broader context is crucial for accurately classifying phrases as temporal or non-temporal. Ultimately, a robust system for detecting present time references in French must combine comprehensive lexical resources with sophisticated grammatical and semantic understanding to capture both the explicit and implicit ways in which the present is conveyed.3. The Nuances of French Future Tense Conjugation and NLP Detection ChallengesDetecting future tense in French text presents its own set of challenges for NLP systems, stemming from the language's specific verb conjugation patterns and the way these are handled by different NLP libraries.3.1. French Verb Conjugation Patterns for the Future TenseFrench employs two primary ways to express future actions: the futur simple (simple future) and the futur proche (near future).24 Understanding the conjugation rules for both is essential for accurate NLP detection.The futur simple is formed by adding specific endings to the infinitive of the verb.24 For regular verbs ending in -er (e.g., parler - to speak) and -ir (e.g., finir - to finish), the endings are added directly to the infinitive: -ai, -as, -a, -ons, -ez, -ont. For regular verbs ending in -re (e.g., rendre - to return), the final 'e' is removed before adding the same endings.24However, French has a significant number of irregular verbs that have unique stems in the futur simple.24 Some of the most common include être (to be) with the stem ser- (e.g., je serai - I will be), avoir (to have) with the stem aur- (e.g., j'aurai - I will have), aller (to go) with the stem ir- (e.g., j'irai - I will go), faire (to do/make) with the stem fer- (e.g., je ferai - I will do), pouvoir (to be able to) with the stem pourr- (e.g., je pourrai - I will be able to), vouloir (to want) with the stem voudr- (e.g., je voudrai - I will want), devoir (to have to) with the stem devr- (e.g., je devrai - I will have to), venir (to come) with the stem viendr- (e.g., je viendrai - I will come), voir (to see) with the stem verr- (e.g., je verrai - I will see), recevoir (to receive) with the stem recevr- (e.g., je recevrai - I will receive), and savoir (to know) with the stem saur- (e.g., je saurai - I will know).24 Additionally, verbs ending in -yer (like essayer - to try) often see their 'y' transform into an 'i' in the future (e.g., j'essaierai), and some -er verbs (like acheter - to buy) will double the final consonant of the stem before adding the endings (e.g., j'achèterai).24The futur proche, on the other hand, is a periphrastic construction formed by conjugating the verb aller (to go) in the present tense followed by the infinitive of the verb indicating the future action.20 For example, "Je vais parler" (I am going to speak) uses the present tense of aller ("vais") and the infinitive of parler.While both tenses refer to the future, the futur proche is generally used for actions that are imminent or more certain, whereas the futur simple often refers to events in the more distant future or those that are less certain.26 However, in modern spoken French, the futur proche is increasingly used even for events that are not immediately about to happen.26The existence of two future tenses with distinct formations and subtle differences in usage adds complexity to the task of future tense detection in French NLP. Systems need to be able to identify both the synthetic futur simple and the analytic futur proche, as well as handle the numerous irregular verb forms in the futur simple.3.2. spaCy and Stanza's Handling of French Verb Tense Detection and Morphological AnalysisTo understand why spaCy might fail to detect certain future tense forms, it's crucial to examine how both spaCy and Stanza, another prominent NLP library, handle French morphological analysis and verb tense detection.spaCy relies on trained statistical models (pipelines) for various NLP tasks, including part-of-speech tagging and morphological analysis.32 These models, such as fr_core_news_sm and fr_core_news_lg, are trained on large corpora of French text to predict linguistic features.32 spaCy provides access to morphological features of tokens through attributes like Token.tag, Token.pos, and Token.morph.33 While it can identify the general tense of a verb as "Past," "Present," or "Future" 36, research and user discussions indicate that spaCy's French models have limitations in providing more granular tense information, such as distinguishing between different future forms or identifying person and number within a tense.36 There have also been reported issues with the lemmatization of certain French verb forms.38Stanza, developed by Stanford NLP, also offers morphological analysis for French through its POSProcessor.39 Stanza's analysis includes Universal POS (UPOS) tags, treebank-specific POS (XPOS) tags, and universal morphological features (UFeats).40 Research has shown that Stanza can be used to extract tense and mode information for French verbs with a high degree of accuracy.41 This suggests that Stanza's morphological analyzer might provide a more detailed representation of verb tenses in French compared to spaCy's more general tense categories.The difference in the level of detail provided by spaCy and Stanza in their morphological analysis likely contributes to the challenges in accurately detecting specific future tense conjugations. spaCy's broader "Future" tag might not capture the nuances of different forms, potentially leading to misclassifications or a lack of specific identification.3.3. Reasons for spaCy's Failure to Detect "adopterons" and "développerons"The specific examples from the user query, "adopterons" (future of adopter - to adopt) and "développerons" (future of développer - to develop), both represent the first-person plural (nous) form of the futur simple. spaCy's potential failure to correctly identify these forms as such likely stems from several factors related to its morphological analysis capabilities for French.One significant reason could be the ambiguity of the "-ons" ending.32 This ending is used for the first-person plural (nous) in both the present indicative (e.g., nous adoptons - we adopt) and the futur simple (e.g., nous adopterons - we will adopt). Without a sufficiently detailed morphological analysis that includes features for tense, person, and number, spaCy's statistical model might struggle to differentiate between these two tenses based solely on the "-ons" ending. The model might be influenced by the higher frequency of the present indicative in general text and thus default to that classification.Another contributing factor could be the level of granularity in spaCy's tense tagging.36 Even if spaCy correctly identifies a verb as being in the "Future," it might not provide the specific conjugation details, such as the person and number. For tasks requiring precise identification of verb forms, a general "Future" tag is insufficient. The user's query, which involves potentially converting verb forms to another language, highlights this need for detailed morphological information, including tense, person, and gender.36 spaCy's current French models might not consistently provide this level of detail for future tense conjugations.Furthermore, the training data used for spaCy's French models plays a crucial role. If the model was not trained on a sufficiently diverse set of examples showcasing the first-person plural futur simple, or if the relevant morphological features were not adequately emphasized during training, the model might underperform in identifying these specific forms. Discussions within the spaCy community and in research (e.g.38) also point to ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy of morphological analysis for French, suggesting that this is an area under continuous development.In summary, spaCy's difficulty in detecting "adopterons" and "développerons" as first-person plural futur simple is likely due to the morphological ambiguity of the "-ons" ending, the potentially limited granularity of its tense tagging, and the characteristics of its training data. Addressing these limitations might require exploring alternative NLP libraries with more detailed morphological analysis capabilities, fine-tuning existing spaCy models, or employing rule-based approaches to complement statistical methods.4. Exploring the Landscape of Alternative French NLP LibrariesGiven the limitations observed with spaCy in detecting specific future tense conjugations, exploring alternative French NLP libraries that offer more robust morphological analysis and verb tense detection capabilities is a logical step. Several libraries beyond spaCy and Stanza are available for French NLP, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.354.1. Review of Alternative LibrariesNLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a foundational Python library for NLP that provides a wide range of tools for tasks like tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and classification.35 While perhaps not as streamlined for production use as spaCy, NLTK offers modules for morphological analysis in French, including stemmers and lemmatizers.52 These tools could potentially be used to identify verb stems and infer tense information, although they might require more manual configuration and rule definition compared to more specialized libraries.Polyglot is a Python library known for its extensive multilingual support, encompassing language detection, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, and importantly, morphological analysis for a large number of languages, including French.47 Polyglot leverages resources like Wiktionary for its morphological analysis, making it a versatile option for projects requiring support for multiple languages. Its reported efficiency and straightforward usage make it a potential alternative to consider.48Simplemma is a lightweight Python library focused on lemmatization for multiple languages.49 While primarily designed for finding base forms of words, its multilingual approach and simplicity could be beneficial for identifying verb stems, which is a crucial step in tense detection. Simplemma boasts fast initialization and low memory usage, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.50 It does not rely on morphosyntactic information, which could be both an advantage (for simplicity) and a disadvantage (potentially less accurate tense detection).mlconjug3 is a Python library specifically developed for conjugating verbs in several languages, including French.36 This library uses machine learning techniques and pre-trained models to conjugate any verb, even novel ones. Its focus on verb conjugation suggests that it could be highly effective in accurately identifying verb tenses, including the futur simple, and potentially providing detailed information about person and number. The library is also designed to be easily modified and retrained, offering flexibility for specific NLP tasks.51Pattern is another Python NLP library that offers a range of functionalities, including part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, and support for multiple languages, including French.36 Its part-of-speech tagger for French might provide more detailed verb tense information than spaCy's general categories, although its documentation and recent activity might need to be assessed for current applicability.Beyond these general-purpose or conjugation-focused libraries, other more specialized resources exist. BookNLP-fr is tailored for analyzing French literary texts, offering semantic annotations like entity recognition and coreference resolution.46 While not primarily focused on tense detection, its detailed linguistic analysis might indirectly aid in this task within its specific domain. UralicNLP is designed for Uralic languages 53, and OFrLex is a lexicon for Old French 54, making them less relevant for modern French tense detection. CamemBERT and Flaubert are French language models (transformers) that can be used for various NLP tasks, including part-of-speech tagging and potentially fine-tuned for tense detection.474.2. Comparative AnalysisComparing these alternative libraries in the context of the user's query requires considering their strengths and weaknesses regarding the detection of implicit present time references, accurate identification of future tense conjugations, and handling of mixed temporal references.For detecting implicit present time references, libraries with accurate part-of-speech tagging and good morphological analysis capabilities would be beneficial. NLTK, Polyglot, and Pattern all offer part-of-speech tagging for French.35 Polyglot and Simplemma also provide morphological analysis.47 The accuracy of these libraries in correctly tagging present tense verbs and understanding the context where the present tense implies near future would need to be evaluated.When it comes to accurately identifying future tense conjugations, mlconjug3 stands out as a strong contender due to its specific focus on verb conjugation.51 Its ability to conjugate any French verb suggests a high likelihood of accurately identifying futur simple forms like "adopterons" and "développerons," potentially even providing information about person and number. Stanza also showed promising results in research for tense prediction.41 Other libraries might rely on their part-of-speech tagging, where the granularity of the "Future" tag could vary.Handling mixed temporal references is a more complex task that often requires discourse analysis capabilities. While libraries like spaCy and Stanza offer dependency parsing, which can aid in understanding sentence structure and relationships, not all the reviewed alternatives might have this functionality as a primary focus. Libraries that can be integrated with contextual language models like CamemBERT or Flaubert might have an advantage in understanding the flow of temporal context across sentences.Factors like ease of use, performance, language coverage, and community support also play a crucial role in choosing an NLP library. spaCy is known for its speed and ease of use 34, while NLTK has a large community and extensive documentation.48 Polyglot offers broad language coverage 47, and Simplemma is praised for its lightweight nature.50 mlconjug3 is specialized but might have a smaller community compared to more general libraries.Ultimately, the most suitable alternative library will depend on the specific needs of the NLP task. For projects heavily focused on accurate verb tense identification, especially the futur simple, mlconjug3 appears to be a promising option. For broader NLP tasks requiring multilingual support, Polyglot could be a good choice. Stanza also warrants consideration due to its reported accuracy in tense detection. Empirical evaluation of these libraries on the specific challenges highlighted in the user's query would provide valuable insights into their relative performance.5. Navigating Mixed Temporal References in French DiscourseRecognizing and interpreting mixed temporal references, where present and future time frames intertwine within a French discourse, presents a significant challenge for NLP systems. Understanding how temporal context flows and how references to different time periods are managed is crucial for accurate interpretation.5.1. Temporal Context Flow in French DiscourseTemporal context in French discourse is a dynamic construct established and maintained through a combination of linguistic elements.6 Temporal connectives, such as "alors" (then/so), "ensuite" (then), and "puis" (then), play a vital role in explicitly signaling temporal relationships between clauses and sentences.61 For instance, "alors" can indicate temporal succession or a consequential relationship between events 61, while "ensuite" and "puis" typically denote chronological sequencing.62 These connectives guide the reader or listener through the temporal progression of the discourse.Verb tenses are equally important in establishing a temporal frame of reference.60 The choice of tense in a sentence anchors the described event or state to a specific point in time relative to the moment of speaking or a previously established reference point. Changes in verb tense often signal shifts in the temporal context of the discourse, indicating a move from past to present, present to future, or vice versa. For example, a narrative might begin in the past tense, then shift to the present tense for direct dialogue, and perhaps transition to the future tense when discussing subsequent events.The concept of temporal grounding is also essential. Events and statements within a discourse are typically anchored to a specific point in time, often the present of the utterance.60 Subsequent temporal references are then interpreted relative to this initial grounding or to other established time points within the discourse. This creates a temporal framework that allows for coherent understanding.5.2. Temporal Anaphora Resolution in FrenchTemporal anaphora resolution involves identifying and interpreting temporal expressions or verb tenses that refer back to previously established time points or intervals within the discourse.61 Similar to how pronouns refer back to nouns, temporal anaphors avoid redundancy by referencing a time that has already been introduced. For example, in the sequence "Il a plu hier. Aujourd'hui, le soleil brille" (It rained yesterday. Today, the sun is shining), "aujourd'hui" (today) refers to the day following "hier" (yesterday), establishing a temporal link between the two sentences.Resolving temporal anaphora can be challenging for NLP systems, especially when dealing with ambiguous references or multiple time frames within a text. The system needs to maintain a representation of the temporal context as it unfolds and correctly link subsequent temporal expressions to their antecedents. This often requires understanding the semantic compatibility between the anaphoric expression and the previously mentioned time.615.3. Combining Present and Future Time ReferencesFrench discourse frequently combines present and future time references in various ways.11 One common phenomenon is the use of the present tense to express the near future.15 This is often signaled by the presence of future temporal adverbs, such as "demain" (tomorrow), "bientôt" (soon) 1, or "la semaine prochaine" (next week).1 For example, "Je vais au cinéma demain" (I am going to the cinema tomorrow) uses the present tense of "aller" to convey a future action. NLP systems need to recognize this pragmatic extension of the present tense meaning.Furthermore, sentences often combine present states or actions with future implications or plans.11 For instance, "Je suis en congé pour deux semaines en juillet" (I will be on leave for two weeks in July) expresses a present state (being on leave) that extends into the future. Understanding this relationship requires analyzing the semantic connections between the clauses or phrases involved. Verbs of intention or planning in the present tense, such as "compter" (to plan) or "vouloir" (to want), are often linked to future actions, as in "Je compte partir en vacances bientôt" (I plan to go on vacation soon).Analyzing these combinations requires NLP systems to go beyond simple sentence-level analysis and consider the broader discourse context. Identifying the temporal anchors and the relationships between different time points is crucial for accurately interpreting the intended meaning when present and future time references are intertwined.6. Conclusion and RecommendationsThe analysis presented in this report underscores the complexities involved in accurately detecting temporal references in French text using NLP tools. Challenges persist in identifying implicit present time references, achieving granular accuracy in future tense detection, and interpreting mixed temporal references within a discourse.To improve temporal reference detection in French NLP, the following recommendations are proposed:

For Implicit Present Time References: Develop more comprehensive lexical resources that include a wide range of explicit present time expressions, encompassing multi-word phrases and idiomatic usage. Train NLP models on larger and more diverse French corpora to enhance their ability to recognize the implicit present conveyed through verb tense and discourse context. Explore the integration of pragmatic analysis techniques to infer present time references based on contextual cues and speaker intent.


For Future Tense Detection: Evaluate and potentially adopt NLP libraries like Stanza that offer more detailed morphological analysis for French, which could lead to more accurate identification of future tense conjugations, including person and number. Consider fine-tuning existing spaCy models with additional data specifically focusing on future tense examples or developing rule-based systems to complement statistical methods, particularly for handling irregular verbs and the morphological ambiguity of endings like "-ons." Investigate the use of specialized verb conjugation libraries such as mlconjug3 in conjunction with general NLP pipelines to enhance the accuracy of future tense identification.


For Mixed Temporal References: Incorporate discourse analysis modules into NLP pipelines to enable the tracking of temporal context and the understanding of relationships between sentences and clauses. Develop or utilize existing techniques for temporal anaphora resolution in French to correctly link temporal expressions across the discourse. Train models to recognize the patterns and semantic relationships indicative of combined present and future time references, paying particular attention to the use of the present tense for the near future and the expression of future intentions or plans in the present.

Further research should focus on the creation of richly annotated French corpora specifically designed for temporal reference detection, encompassing explicit, implicit, and mixed temporal references. Additionally, the development of novel NLP models that more effectively integrate linguistic knowledge and discourse context holds promise for advancing the accuracy and reliability of temporal reference detection in French NLP applications across various domains. The progress in this area is crucial for enabling more sophisticated and nuanced French language understanding in a wide range of computational applications.Table 1: Common French Temporal Expressions for Present Time
