## Plan for Data Preprocessing

This document outlines the plan for preprocessing the French language transcripts to prepare them for opinion analysis. The preprocessing will follow these key phases, drawing upon the research detailed in the provided tickets.

**Phase 1: Data Ingestion and Encoding Standardization**

1.  **Locate and Ingest Transcripts:** The first step involves locating and ingesting all the French language transcript files. The file formats may vary (e.g., `.txt`, `.pdf`).
2.  **Encoding Verification and Normalization:**
    * **Action:** For each transcript, verify the character encoding. The standard encoding for this project is UTF-8.
    * **Action:** If a transcript is not encoded in UTF-8, it will be converted to UTF-8 to ensure consistent handling of French accented characters throughout the preprocessing pipeline. This will mitigate potential issues like mojibake[cite: 1].
3.  **Initial Data Quality Check:** Perform a preliminary quality check to identify any immediately obvious issues, such as completely unreadable files or significant formatting inconsistencies that might require initial attention.

**Phase 2: Preprocessing Tasks**

1.  **Tokenization:** The raw text of each transcript will be broken down into individual tokens (words). This process will need to handle French-specific linguistic features like contractions and elisions[cite: 2].
    * **Tool:** spaCy with the `fr_core_news_sm` model or Stanza will be used for accurate tokenization[cite: 2].
2.  **Sentence Segmentation:** The tokens will then be grouped into sentences to provide context for analysis[cite: 2].
    * **Tool:** spaCy or Stanza will also be used for sentence boundary detection[cite: 2].
3.  **Lemmatization:** Each token will be reduced to its base form (lemma). This will help in standardizing the vocabulary and improving the accuracy of downstream analysis[cite: 2].
    * **Tool:** The `FrenchLefffLemmatizer` will be used for precise French lemmatization. Alternatively, the lemmatization capabilities within spaCy or Stanza can be utilized[cite: 2].

**Phase 3: Text Segmentation for Analysis**

1.  **Chunking into Semantic Units:** The preprocessed text will be further segmented into chunks of 2 to 10 lines. The aim is to create meaningful units that represent complete thoughts or exchanges within the conversations[cite: 3].
2.  **Segmentation Strategy:** A hybrid approach will be employed, considering speaker turns, thematic shifts, and the presence of French discourse markers to determine segment boundaries[cite: 3]. The goal is to balance the line count with semantic coherence.

**Phase 4: Temporal Marker Identification**

1.  **Detection of Time References:** Temporal markers indicating references to specific timeframes (e.g., 2023 and 2050) will be identified within the text segments[cite: 4].
2.  **Techniques:** Regular expressions and linguistic analysis (e.g., using spaCy to identify date entities and verb tenses) will be used for this task[cite: 4].

**Phase 5: Handling PDF Transcripts (If Applicable)**

1.  **PDF Extraction Process:** If any transcripts are in PDF format, specialized libraries will be used to extract the text content[cite: 5].
    * **Tool:** PyMuPDF will be the primary tool for extraction due to its accuracy in handling French characters. pdfplumber may be used for more complex layouts or for extracting temporal codes based on their position[cite: 5].
2.  **Encoding Management:** Special attention will be paid to potential encoding issues within PDF documents, and manual overrides will be used if necessary to ensure correct character representation[cite: 5].

**Phase 6: Quality Control and Refinement**

1.  **Spot Checks:** Throughout the preprocessing, spot checks will be performed on the output to ensure the accuracy of each step.
2.  **Addressing Issues:** Any identified issues, such as incorrect tokenization, lemmatization errors, or segmentation problems, will be addressed and corrected.

This plan provides a structured approach to preprocessing the French language transcripts. The specific tools and techniques outlined are based on the research conducted and aim to produce high-quality, analysis-ready data.
