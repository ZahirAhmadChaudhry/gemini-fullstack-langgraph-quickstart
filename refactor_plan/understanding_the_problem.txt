Automating Opinion Analysis using NLP in Sustainability Discussions

This document outlines the research challenge of analyzing French language transcripts from group discussions about organizational sustainability and transformation, along with establishing a comprehensive technical framework for implementing an automated opinion analysis system using Natural Language Processing and Advanced Machine Learning techniques.
1.	Contextual Framework and Analysis Requirements
The research challenge centers on analyzing French language transcripts from group discussions about organizational sustainability and transformation. The dataset comprises approximately 300 pages of total volume across all discussion groups (labeled A through H), containing time-coded conversations among multiple participants. These discussions explicitly address both current (2023) and future (2050) scenarios regarding organizational transformation, with clear temporal markers present in the transcriptions. The analysis framework employs a structured approach where experts manually analyze these transcripts to identify and categorize opinions. The categorization follows a hierarchical structure with four primary components: second-order concepts, first-order reformulated items, original first-order items, and supporting details. This structure allows for detailed capture of paradoxes and tensions present in the discussions about organizational transformation.
 
Regarding data quality and structure, while we currently lack consistent speaker identification throughout the transcripts, there are original audio files available for potential future enhanced transcription. The project specifically aims to develop NLP tools for French language processing, without requiring translations to other languages. The development of French language NLP capabilities will require extensive literature review to identify available tools and assess their suitability for this specific domain. This investigation needs to encompass both general French language processing capabilities and domain-specific requirements for analyzing organizational and sustainability discussions.
2.	Expert Categorization Methodology
The categorization process employs a paradox approach rooted in management theory, focusing on generalized opinions rather than individual perspectives. The analysis specifically targets paradoxes and conflicting objectives discussed by participants, without extracting information about specific companies or organizations. A paradox may emerge from a single participant's statement or develop through interactions between multiple discussion participants. The identification of relevant content occurs whenever a speaker addresses difficult-to-resolve tensions, which then triggers category assignment. The categorization relies heavily on identifying key terms or synonymous phrases within quotes that establish "versus" relationships between competing concepts. The spatial boundaries of relevant content remain variable, potentially spanning from two to ten lines of text, necessitating a flexible extraction methodology to capture complete paradoxical expressions regardless of their textual extent.
3.	Structural and Relational Framework
Relationships between different categories are documented according to established management science knowledge, with further refinement of this structure requiring additional literature investigation. Cross-referencing between related opinions occurs naturally through the discussion analysis process. The reconciliation of conflicting expert interpretations follows a consensus-based approach, incorporating expert opinions within the analytical workflow. This process may benefit from exploration of Large Language Model-based techniques such as agentic workflows to facilitate collective decision-making among expert analysts. The system design must account for these collaborative interpretation aspects, providing mechanisms for experts to discuss and resolve categorization disagreements while maintaining consistency in the final analytical output.
4.	Participant Demographics and Implementation Context
Each discussion group typically comprises three to four distinct speakers, with a consistent composition throughout individual sessions. Participants represent diverse professional backgrounds including business owners/founders, managers, consultants, association managers, public administration personnel, and academic experts in management sciences. This heterogeneity contributes to the richness and complexity of the sustainability discussions under analysis. The intended end users of the automated system include seven researchers who will analyze future collected data, with potential broader application for doctoral students and interns.
Technical system requirements encompass a graphical user interface in a web-based application format, transcript editing capabilities, output modification functionality, visualization tools, model interpretability features, and comparative report analysis capabilities. The anticipated volume of future discussions approximates the current dataset size of approximately 300 pages. System integration will occur within the university network infrastructure.
5.	Paradox Identification and Quality Control Measures
The comprehensive cataloging of possible paradox types requires additional literature review to establish appropriate classification rules specific to this study. The methodology for identifying and incorporating new paradoxes into the analytical framework requires further development in collaboration with domain experts. Additional consultation with subject matter experts is necessary to determine precise criteria for when a tension qualifies as a paradox within the sustainability discourse context. 
Regarding data quality, the transcription quality is characterized as nearly perfect, performed by human professional transcribers. This professional human transcription approach serves as the primary quality control measure, though no formal marking system for transcription errors or uncertainties has been implemented. The high fidelity of transcriptions provides a reliable foundation for subsequent NLP-based analysis.
6.	Future Development Pathways
To ensure a smooth and scalable solution, the project will begin with a baseline approach using basic NLP techniques tailored to French language processing. This baseline will serve as a foundation for understanding the dataset, identifying key patterns, and establishing a performance benchmark before transitioning to more advanced models. The baseline approach will involve text preprocessing using tools such as spaCy, which offers a French language model for accurate tokenization, stop words removal, and lemmatization, preparing the data for further analysis by reducing noise and standardizing the text. Topic identification will be performed through keyword extraction and frequency analysis, focusing on sustainability-related terms in French, such as "durabilité," "environnement," and "énergie renouvelable," to provide an initial understanding of the main themes discussed in the transcripts. Opinion detection will be achieved using basic sentiment analysis with a French sentiment lexicon to identify positive and negative tones, which may indicate agreement or disagreement, while contrastive markers in French, such as "mais" and "cependant," will be used to flag potential tensions or conflicting opinions. Temporal contexts will be handled by identifying markers such as "en 2023" or "d’ici 2050" to distinguish between current and future scenarios, ensuring that the analysis remains relevant to the appropriate timeframe. This baseline approach will not only provide valuable insights into the dataset but also inform the development of more sophisticated models by highlighting areas where advanced techniques can offer improvements.
To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the automated system, a plan for expert validation and continuous improvement has been established. Experts will review the annotations generated by both the baseline NLP approach and any subsequent advanced models to verify their correctness and provide feedback. This validation process will be integrated into an online learning pipeline, allowing the model to be consistently improved over time using data collected from similar audio or video open-source interviews. This iterative approach will help address any biases or variances in the model's performance, ensuring that it remains effective and adaptable to new data.
Parallel development efforts include a literature review and baseline analysis of existing annotated datasets to establish a foundational understanding of the problem domain. Future data collection may involve the extraction of similar paradox discussions on sustainability issues in French, identified through key terms established in the current dataset. For video content, experts can highlight relevant segments, provide source links, and transcribe content to generate additional training data. This approach will allow for the continuous improvement of the system through expanded and diversified training data. The immediate next steps involve analyzing the existing annotations to establish baseline metrics around category distribution and text segment characteristics.
This document has outlined a comprehensive approach to automating opinion analysis in French sustainability discussions, beginning with a robust baseline NLP approach and incorporating expert validation and continuous improvement mechanisms. By starting with basic NLP techniques, the project ensures a solid foundation for understanding the dataset and measuring progress as more advanced models are developed. The use of French-specific tools and the focus on sustainability-related paradoxes provide a tailored solution to the unique challenges of this research. With a clear plan for iterative improvement and expert oversight, the project is well-positioned to deliver a scalable and effective system for analyzing future datasets.
